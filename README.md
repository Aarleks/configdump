# Arch Linux Dotfiles and Setup

This is the dotfiles repo for my Arch installations.

Various bits of the code here has been lifted from other places and people, some of whom are lost from my memory. Where I remember I provide attribution.
This is now my main Linux config.

## Tmux

`email` function in zsh folder
`tman` function in zsh folder
`.tmux` files in project directories (including `$HOME`)
`tm` function in `.scripts/` to present a list of tmux sessions to pick from.
